# FABRIC-011: Authentication & Authorization System

## Story Title
As a **System Administrator**, I want a comprehensive authentication and authorization system so that I can ensure secure access to the Fabric Platform with role-based permissions.

## Description
Implement a robust authentication and authorization system with JWT tokens, role-based access control (RBAC), and integration with enterprise identity providers for secure multi-user access.

## User Persona
- **Primary**: System Administrator
- **Secondary**: Security Lead, DevOps Engineer (Alex)

## Business Value
- Ensures compliance with enterprise security requirements
- Provides granular access control for different user roles
- Enables integration with existing enterprise identity systems
- Reduces security risk through proper authentication mechanisms

## Status
**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** ðŸ”„

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with configurable permissions
- [ ] Integration with enterprise identity providers (LDAP/AD)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- [ ] Session management with configurable timeouts
- [ ] Audit logging for all authentication events
- [ ] Password policy enforcement
- [ ] Account lockout protection
- [ ] Single Sign-On (SSO) capability

## Sprint Assignment
**Sprint**: Phase 2 (Q4 2025) - ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED** (Priority: High)

## Definition of Done
- JWT authentication fully implemented
- Role-based access control functional
- Enterprise identity integration working
- Multi-factor authentication enabled
- Security audit logging active
- Unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- Security testing completed
- Penetration testing passed
- User acceptance testing completed

## Dependencies
- User management database schema
- Enterprise identity provider configuration
- Security requirements documentation
- Compliance requirements (SOX, PCI-DSS)

## Security Requirements
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens with RS256 signing
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable (default 8 hours)
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout
- **MFA**: TOTP or SMS-based second factor
- **Audit**: All authentication events logged
- **Encryption**: All passwords encrypted with bcrypt

## Notes
- Integration with enterprise identity providers is critical for adoption
- Role-based permissions should be configurable and extensible
- Security implementation must meet financial services compliance requirements
- Multi-factor authentication should be configurable per user role
- Session management should support concurrent sessions with limits
