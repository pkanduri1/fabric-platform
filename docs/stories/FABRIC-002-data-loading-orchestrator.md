# FABRIC-002: Data Loading Orchestrator Implementation

## Story Title
As a **Data Operations Manager**, I want a comprehensive data loading orchestrator so that I can reliably process large data files with validation, error handling, and audit trails.

## Description
Implement the core DataLoadOrchestrator that coordinates the entire data loading workflow including configuration loading, validation, SQL*Loader execution, and audit trail generation.

## User Persona
- **Primary**: Data Operations Manager (Sarah)
- **Secondary**: Data Analyst (Mike), Compliance Officer (Jennifer)

## Business Value
- Reduces manual data processing effort by 60%
- Ensures 99.9% data loading reliability
- Provides complete audit trails for compliance
- Supports processing of 10M+ records per hour

## Status  
**COMPLETE** âœ…

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] âœ… DataLoadOrchestrator coordinates entire workflow
- [ ] âœ… Configuration loading with database + JSON fallback
- [ ] âœ… File validation before processing
- [ ] âœ… SQL*Loader integration with dynamic control files
- [ ] âœ… Error threshold checking and handling
- [ ] âœ… Comprehensive audit trail generation
- [ ] âœ… Post-load validation and reconciliation
- [ ] âœ… Performance metrics collection
- [ ] âœ… Proper exception handling and cleanup
