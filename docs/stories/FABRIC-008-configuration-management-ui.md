# FABRIC-008: Configuration Management UI

## Story Title
As a **Data Analyst**, I want a web-based configuration management interface so that I can easily create, modify, and manage data loading configurations without technical assistance.

## Description
Develop a comprehensive React-based UI for managing data loading configurations, validation rules, and error thresholds with real-time validation and intuitive user experience.

## User Persona
- **Primary**: Data Analyst (Mike)
- **Secondary**: Data Operations Manager (Sarah), System Administrator

## Business Value
- Reduces configuration time by 70% through intuitive UI
- Eliminates need for technical support for configuration changes
- Provides real-time validation to prevent configuration errors
- Enables self-service configuration management

## Status
**75% COMPLETE** âœ… (Core functionality implemented, needs monitoring integration)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] âœ… Configuration management dashboard with source system overview
- [x] âœ… Create/Edit configuration forms with drag-and-drop interface
- [x] âœ… Advanced field mapping with transformation types (source, constant, composite, conditional)
- [x] âœ… Template-based configuration wizard with 3-step process
- [x] âœ… Real-time configuration validation with backend integration
- [x] âœ… YAML configuration preview and generation
- [x] âœ… Import/Export configuration functionality through templates
- [x] âœ… Mobile-responsive Material-UI design
- [x] âœ… Professional navigation with collapsible sidebar
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Integration with data loading job monitoring
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Error threshold configuration screens integration
- [ ] ðŸ”„ Role-based access control implementation
