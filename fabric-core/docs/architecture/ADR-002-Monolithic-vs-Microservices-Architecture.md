**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Architect:** Principal Enterprise Architect  
**Context:** Fabric Platform Application Architecture Strategy  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Decision:** Adopt a "Modular Monolith with Microservices Readiness" architecture pattern, transitioning from the current multi-module monolith to domain-aligned modules with clear service boundaries.

**Rationale:** This approach provides immediate operational benefits while positioning for future microservices migration when business complexity and team scale justify the transition.

---

## CONTEXT

The Fabric Platform currently implements a well-architected multi-module Maven monolith with clear separation of concerns. As the platform scales to support 100+ source systems and expand into real-time processing, we need to evaluate the optimal architectural pattern for:

1. **Operational Complexity:** Managing deployments, scaling, and maintenance
2. **Team Productivity:** Supporting distributed development teams
3. **Technology Evolution:** Adopting cloud-native patterns and technologies
4. **Business Agility:** Faster feature delivery and independent service evolution

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Multi-Module Monolith Strengths:**
- **Excellent Modularity:** Clean separation into `fabric-api`, `fabric-batch`, `fabric-data-loader`, `fabric-utils`
- **Strong Cohesion:** Shared domain model and consistent data access patterns
- **Deployment Simplicity:** Single artifact deployment with unified configuration
- **Transaction Management:** ACID transactions across multiple data operations
- **Development Efficiency:** Simplified debugging, testing, and local development

**Current Module Structure:**
```
fabric-core/
├── fabric-api/          # REST API and web layer
├── fabric-batch/        # Spring Batch processing engine
├── fabric-data-loader/  # SQL*Loader and validation engine
└── fabric-utils/        # Shared utilities and models
```

### Business Drivers for Architectural Evolution

**Scale Requirements:**
- Support 100+ source systems with independent deployment cycles
- Enable 5+ development teams working on different platform areas
- Handle 10x data volume growth over next 3 years
- Support multiple deployment environments (dev, test, staging, prod)

**Technology Requirements:**
- Cloud-native deployment patterns (Kubernetes, service mesh)
- Independent technology stack evolution per domain
- Enhanced observability and distributed tracing
- Advanced resilience patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads)

```java
// Enhanced modular structure with domain boundaries
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class FabricApplication {
    
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty("fabric.modules.api.enabled")
    public ApiModule apiModule() { return new ApiModule(); }
    
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty("fabric.modules.batch.enabled")
    public BatchModule batchModule() { return new BatchModule(); }
}
```

- Add comprehensive domain-level monitoring and metrics

**Technical Implementation:**
```java
// Domain service architecture
@Component
public class DataLoadingDomain {
    
    // Internal domain logic
    private final SqlLoaderExecutor sqlLoaderExecutor;
    private final ValidationEngine validationEngine;
    private final AuditTrailManager auditManager;
    
    // External-ready service interface
    @Async
    @Monitored
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "data-loading")
    public CompletableFuture<DataLoadResult> processDataLoad(DataLoadRequest request) {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Validate request
            ValidationResult validation = validationEngine.validate(request);
            if (!validation.isValid()) {
                throw new ValidationException(validation.getErrors());
            }
            
            // Execute load with full audit trail
            DataLoadResult result = sqlLoaderExecutor.executeLoad(request);
            auditManager.recordDataLoad(request, result);
            
            return result;
        });
    }
}
```

    public void publishDataLoadCompleted(DataLoadResult result) {
        DataLoadCompletedEvent event = new DataLoadCompletedEvent(
            result.getJobId(),
            result.getSourceSystem(),
            result.getProcessedRecords(),
            result.getCompletionTime()
        );
        
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(event);
    }
}

@EventListener
@Component
public class AuditEventHandler {
    
    @Async("audit-executor")
    public void handleDataLoadCompleted(DataLoadCompletedEvent event) {
        auditService.recordCompletedLoad(event);
        notificationService.sendCompletionNotification(event);
    }
}
```

**Resilience Patterns:**
```yaml
Circuit Breaker Configuration:
  data-loading:

CREATE SCHEMA fabric_batch_processing;  -- Batch processing domain
CREATE SCHEMA fabric_configuration;     -- Configuration domain
CREATE SCHEMA fabric_audit;            -- Audit and compliance domain
CREATE SCHEMA fabric_shared;           -- Shared reference data

-- Migration path for future service extraction
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW data_loading_api AS
SELECT * FROM fabric_data_loading.data_load_configs
WHERE tenant_id = current_tenant();
```

**Container Architecture:**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production optimization
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/target/fabric-core.jar .
COPY --from=build /app/config/ ./config/

# Health check endpoint
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1

EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "fabric-core.jar"]
```

**Kubernetes Manifests:**
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment with service mesh readiness
apiVersion: apps/v1

            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

**Investment:** $75K-100K

---

### Phase 4: Selective Service Extraction Strategy (Months 5-6)

**Objectives:**
- Define criteria for service extraction based on business value
- Implement extraction tooling and automation
- Deploy first extracted service as proof of concept

**Service Extraction Criteria:**
```yaml
High Priority for Extraction:
  - Independent scaling requirements (different resource profiles)
  - Distinct technology needs (different JVM settings, languages)
  - Separate team ownership with minimal dependencies
  - Clear business domain boundaries
  - Different compliance or security requirements

Low Priority for Extraction:
  - High transaction coupling with other domains
  - Shared complex business logic
  - Limited team resources for independent operation
  - Unclear domain boundaries
```

**Extraction Process:**
```java
// Service extraction with strangler fig pattern
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty("fabric.services.audit.external", havingValue = "true")
public class ExternalAuditServiceConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @Primary
    public AuditService externalAuditService() {
        return new RestTemplateAuditService(auditServiceUrl);
    }
}

// Internal service remains as fallback
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty("fabric.services.audit.external", havingValue = "false", matchIfMissing = true)
public class InternalAuditServiceConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public AuditService internalAuditService() {
        return new DatabaseAuditService(auditRepository);
    }
}
```

**Pilot Service Extraction:** Audit Service
- **Rationale:** Clear domain boundaries, minimal transaction coupling
- **Benefits:** Independent scaling, enhanced compliance features
- **Risk:** Low - non-critical path with fallback to internal service

**Investment:** $50K-100K
