# ADR-001: SQL*Loader vs Modern Data Loading Patterns

**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Architect:** Principal Enterprise Architect  
**Context:** Fabric Platform Data Loading Strategy  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Decision:** Retain SQL*Loader as the primary data loading mechanism while implementing modern streaming patterns for real-time use cases.

**Rationale:** SQL*Loader provides unmatched performance for high-volume batch processing in Oracle environments while modern patterns address emerging real-time requirements.

---

## CONTEXT

The Fabric Platform currently utilizes Oracle SQL*Loader as the primary data loading mechanism for processing data from 100+ source systems. With increasing demands for real-time processing and multi-database support, we need to evaluate whether to:

1. **Continue with SQL*Loader-centric approach**
2. **Migrate to modern streaming/micro-batch patterns**
3. **Implement hybrid architecture**

### Current State Analysis

**SQL*Loader Implementation Strengths:**
- **Performance Excellence:** 2-10x faster than INSERT statements for bulk operations
- **Enterprise Maturity:** 20+ years of proven reliability in banking environments
- **Resource Efficiency:** Minimal JVM memory footprint for large datasets
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive bad/discard file management
- **Parallel Processing:** Built-in parallel loading capabilities

**Current Architecture:**
```java
// Sophisticated SQL*Loader executor with enterprise features
public class SqlLoaderExecutor {
    // Retry mechanisms, timeout handling, security controls
    // Comprehensive audit logging and performance tracking
    // Environment validation and error classification
}
```

### Business Requirements

**Volume Requirements:**
- Process 50GB-500GB daily data volumes per source system
- Support peak loads of 1TB+ during month-end processing
- Handle 100+ concurrent source system integrations
- Maintain sub-4 hour processing windows for critical batch jobs

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Complete audit trail for SOX compliance
- PCI-DSS compliance for payment card data
- FFIEC regulatory requirements for banking data
- 99.5% data accuracy with error threshold management
